My first React project, an e-commerce with a silly thematic 

add items at will, they all have a stock taken from the database

You can click on every item's name to navigate to a more detailed item page

Use the filter dropdown menu to order the items based on their range

place an order in the cart to receive a purchase ID

use "Check order" and enter the purchase ID to see which items you ordered

click on the shopping cart icon to navigate to the cart

click the nuke logo to go back to the main page



This was a very hard project, React is a very complex and multifaceted tool and gets really confusing at times. Especially for someone who is just getting into programming in general.

Nonetheless i'm looking forward to using it for work related activities
